I am not sure a quote is inspiring, just like I am not sure that a joke is funny. You may find serious quotes laughable; you may laugh when people misquotes. I respond to those challenges by saying: "That is intended." 

> Laughter, and a lot of it, is the right response to the things that drive us to tears. -- Seneca  

# How to tell a joke 

Don't tell jokes. 

> 君子欲讷于言而敏于行.
> 古者言之不出, 耻躬之不逮也.   -- 论语

But you cannot be shy, right? If you want to be funny, 

> Shyness is no asset to a beggar. -- Odyssey 
> Facts ordinarily do not speak for themselves. 

No, you say, telling jokes is not the right pursuit. 

> 巧言令色足恭, 左丘明耻之, 丘亦耻之. 
> 攻乎异端，斯害己也.  -- 论语 
> 人之岁月精神有限，诵说中度一日，便习行中错一日，纸墨上多一分，便身世上少一分. -- 颜元

But did I hear that right? Because 

> 君子之于天下也, 无适也, 无莫也. --  论语

And don't you like funny people? 

> 君子疾夫舍曰欲之而必为之辞。--  论语
> 圣门之论恕也，“己所不欲，勿施于人”，其道大矣。 -- 章学诚

I need practical skills to survive,

> 必习于事，而后可以言学. --　章学诚 

Do you? 

> 士志于道, 而耻恶衣恶食者, 未足与议也. -- 论语

Say my goal is to be funny. Should I start reading a lot of jokes?

> 博学之 审问之 慎思之 明辨之 笃行之. -- 中庸
> 多闻，择其善者而从之，多见而识之，知之次也。 --  论语

Should I get to know people? 

> 见贤思齐焉, 见不贤而内自省也. 
> 友便辟，友善柔，友便侫，损矣．-- 论语

What! How can I plan? 

> Man is nothing else than his plan. -- Sartre 
> Not even the best plan survives the first shot.
